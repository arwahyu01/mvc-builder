## Requirements

- **Use This Package:** [arwp/main-master](https://packagist.org/packages/arwp/main-master)
- **Laravel:** 11.0 or higher
- **PHP:** 8.2 or higher

## Features

- **Module Generation:**  
  Use the command `php artisan make:mvc [model name]` to generate a new module that includes:
  - ‚úÖ **Controller:** Integrated with complete CRUD functionality.
  - ‚úÖ **Model:** Configured with fillable fields and defined relationships.
  - ‚úÖ **Migration:** Automatically creates the required database tables and relationships.
  - ‚úÖ **Views:** Pre-built views supporting CRUD operations.
  - ‚úÖ **Route:** A dedicated route for module operations.

- **Module Deletion:**  
  - Run `php artisan delete:mvc [name]` to delete MVC files one by one (with confirmation prompts).
  - Run `php artisan delete:mvc [name] --all` to remove all related files and database tables.

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require arwp/mvc
```

## Creating a New Module

To create a new module, execute:

```bash
php artisan make:mvc [model name]
```

**Examples:**

- **Standard Module Creation:**

  ```bash
  php artisan make:mvc User
  ```

- **Customized Component Generation:**

  Generate only specific components (e.g., model and view) by using flags:
  
  ```bash
  php artisan make:mvc User mv  # 'm' for model, 'v' for view, 'c' for controller, 't' for migration, 'r' for route
  ```

- **Single Component Creation:**

  For example, to generate only views:

  ```bash
  php artisan make:mvc User view
  ```

## Deleting a Module

To remove a module along with its associated files and database tables, run:

```bash
php artisan delete:mvc [model name]
```

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Register the Service Provider:**  
   Add the service provider in your `config/app.php`:

   ```php
   'providers' => [
       // ...
       Arwp\Mvc\MvcServiceProvider::class,
       // ...
   ],
   ```

2. **Publish the Package Resources:**  
   Publish the necessary resource files by running:

   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Arwp\Mvc\MvcServiceProvider"
   ```

   This command will publish:
   - `config/mvc.php`
   - `routes/mvc-route.php`
   - `Console/Commands/createMvc.php`
   - `Console/Commands/deleteMvc.php`

3. **Configure Routing:**  
   Update your `RouteServiceProvider.php` to include the MVC routes. For example:

   ```php
   public function boot()
   {
       // ...
       Route::middleware(['web', 'auth', 'backend'])
           ->namespace('App\Http\Controllers\Backend')
           ->group(base_path('routes/mvc-route.php'));
       // ...
   }
   ```

4. **Customize Paths:**  
   In the published `config/mvc.php` file, adjust the paths to suit your project structure:

   ```php
   return [
       'path_controller' => 'app/Http/Controllers/Backend', // Controller folder path
       'path_model'      => 'app/Models',                     // Model folder path
       'path_view'       => 'views/backend',                  // View folder path (e.g., views/backend or views/frontend)
       'path_route'      => 'routes/mvc-route.php',           // Route file path (default: routes/mvc-route.php)
       'route_prefix'    => '',                               // Optional route prefix (e.g., backend, admin)
   ];
   ```

   To modify the default route file, simply update the `path_route` setting accordingly:

   ```php
   return [
       // ...
       'path_route' => 'routes/web.php', // Change this to your desired route file path
       // ...
   ];
   ```

   Lastly, ensure your designated route file (e.g., `routes/web.php`) contains the following marker:

   ```php
   //{{route replacer}} DON'T REMOVE THIS LINE
   ```
